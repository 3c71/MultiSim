# MultiSim library for Android

This library uses reflection and some basic search algorithms to save SIM information to a database. It is useful for simplifying the retreival of SIM information across Android versions and devices. In particular, multi-sim devices can vary significantly in their APIs on Android 5.1 and below. It has been tested on hundreds of models and works on Android 4.3 and up.
